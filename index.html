    <img src="download.jpeg">
    <p>
        Pizza or piza is a culinary preparation that consists of a disc of fermented wheat flour dough, covered with tomato sauce and assorted ingredients that normally include some type of cheese, prepared or smoked meats and herbs, usually oregano or basil, all baked in oven.</p>
<h1 class="title">How does it taste?</h1>
<hr color=blue height=10 width=75%>
<p>It tastes like bread tomato and cheese, chewy, moist, slightly acidic, and sharp. Then once you apply toppings, that changes it. Ham and pineapple, adds salty, sweet and juicy. Pepperoni adds a meatiness and spice</p>
<h>What to eat it with?</h>
<p>You can eat it with a side salad or garlic bread.</p>
<h1>Why i like it?</h1>
<p>Because i love the salty dough with the fresh vegetables on top.</p>
